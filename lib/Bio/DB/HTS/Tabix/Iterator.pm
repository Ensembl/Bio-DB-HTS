=head1 NAME

Bio::DB::HTS::Tabix::Iterator - XS module wrapping around a tabix hts_itr_t

=head1 SYNOPSIS

You shouldn't be instantiating one of these manually it needs a load of pointers.
Usage would be through L<Bio::DB::HTS::Tabix>:

    use feature qw( say );
    use Bio::DB::HTS::Tabix;

    my $tabix = Bio::DB::HTS::Tabix->new( filename => "gerp_plus_plus_31July2014.gz" );

    say $tabix->header;
    my $iter = $tabix->query("1:4000005-4000009");

    while ( my $n = $iter->next ) {
        say $n;
    }

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This is returned from L<Bio::DB::HTS::Tabix>, the only method you need to care about is 'next'.

Don't go importing this and calling new on it if you value your sanity, it won't work.

=head2 Methods

=over 12

=item C<next>

Returns a string with the line from the tabix iterator
